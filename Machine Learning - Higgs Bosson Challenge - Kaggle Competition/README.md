# <b> KAGGLE PROJECT : HIGGS BOSON MACHINE LEARNING CHALLENGE
______________________________________________________

#### <b> DESCRIPTION: 

- The Higgs Boson particle was discovered in 2013. A key property of any particle is how often it decays into other particles. ATLAS is a particle physics experiment taking place at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN that searches for new particles and processes using head-on collisions of protons of extraordinarily high energy. The ATLAS experiment has recently observed a signal of the Higgs boson decaying into two tau particles, but this decay is a small signal buried in background noise. 

- The goal is to improve the procedure that produces the selection region. We provide a training set with signal/background labels and with weights, a test set (without labels and weights), and a formal objective representing an approximation of the median significance (AMS) of the counting test.

### <b> PROJECT OBJECTIVE :
- The objective of the project is to classify an event produced in the particle accelerator as background or signal. As described in the report of the dataset on Kaggle, a background event is explained by the existing theories and previous observations. A signal event, however, indicates a process that cannot be described by previous observations and leads to the potential discovery of a new particle.


### <b> DATASET CHARACTERISTICS:


    The dataset from Kaggle has 800000 events (195.5 MB in total):

    * Training set of 250000 events
    * Test set of 550000 events

    Training set has 30 feature columns, a weight column and a label column. Test set has 30 feature columns and a label column.
