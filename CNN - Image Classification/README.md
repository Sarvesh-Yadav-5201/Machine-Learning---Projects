## <b>This folder contains machine learning projects:
   > Here are few projects examples: 
  >* <b>Hand Written MNIST Digit Classification:</b>This project involves using deep learning models to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

 >* Post Hurricane damage classification: This project involves using deep learning models to classify images of post-hurricane damage. The dataset used in this project consists of satellite images taken after a hurricane.
